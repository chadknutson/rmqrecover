# RMQ Recover

Recovers messages from a RabbitMQ mnesia directory.
It can both report number of messages in all files in a mnesia directory,
but can also republish them to a new cluster. It extracts vhost, exchange,
routing key, properties (including headers) and the body.

## Known issues

By default RabbitMQ embeds messages smaller than 4KB into the queue index.
A message that is enqueued in multiple queues are therefor reported/
republished multiple times. If you republish you can end up with duplicates.
